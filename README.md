# CodingPractice

This repository contains various coding projects I've worked on to maintain and grow my skills across multiple programming languages and platforms. The projects are organized into different folders based on the language or framework used.

## Folder Structure

- **Android**: Contains Android applications built using Jetpack Compose. These projects are designed to enhance my skills as an Android developer.
  - **ComposeBasicsCodelab**: A basic Android app demonstrating the fundamentals of Jetpack Compose. It features a button that, when clicked, displays a list of users represented by numbers. Each user can be expanded to show additional text.
  - **JetpackComposeTutorial**: An Android app showcasing a conversation UI. Each message preview can be clicked to reveal the full message.

- **C++**: Includes various C++ programs that demonstrate my understanding of object-oriented programming, algorithms, and data structures.
  - **FindDuplicate**: This project addresses the problem of identifying duplicate integers in an array where each integer appears either once or twice. The algorithm runs efficiently in O(n) time.
  - **StringReversalRecursive**: A project that reverses a string using recursion, showcasing recursive problem-solving techniques in C++.
  - **TwoSum**: Implements a solution to the classic Two Sum problem, where the goal is to find two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target. The project demonstrates efficient array traversal and pairing techniques in C++.
  - **WorkoutPrinter**: A C++ program that generates and prints a workout calendar. It allows users to create customizable workout schedules based on a workout split that I created. The project demonstrates my understanding of object-oritneted programming, formatting, and date manipulation in C++.
 
- **Java**:

- **JupyterNotebooks**:
